Summary : 
This project is the final project of the “Data Analysis with Python” course from the Dicoding platform. In this project, I implemented data analysis using Python on a bike-sharing dataset, including data wrangling, which consists of gathering data, assessing data, and cleaning data, as well as exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization.

Role : Implement Data Analysis Using Python on a Bike-Sharing Dataset

Tasks :
•	Gathered data using pandas library to load data from a CSV file.
•	Assessed data, including checking data types, missing values, duplicate values, and statistical parameters.
•	Cleaned data, including fixing data types, handling missing values, and removing duplicate values.
•	Explored data during the exploratory data analysis (EDA) process
•	Visualized data using appropriate charts

Results :
Successfully determined the daily performance of bike-sharing over a 2-year period and analyzed the impact of weather on daily bike-sharing usage

Skills Developed :
•	Python
•	Data Cleaning
•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•	Data Visualization
